knogs: keyboard navigation on google search

google used to provide a keyboard shortcuts experiment
  deprecated long ago, removed dec 2011
  the recommended replacements aren't great
  http://blog.nqzero.com/2011/12/googles-experimental-page-used-to-list.html
  google still provides the js: https://www.google.com/js/shortcuts.5.js

knogs is a google chrome extension that provides similar functionality
  uses google's shortcuts.5.js (see above)
  google chrome only - tested on: chrome 17+ on linux/64-bit

install via chrome store:
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lmcekibeekmfpmhanampimjjegknceik

manual install:
  option 1:
    chrome://extensions
    check: developer mode
    click: load unpacked extension and select the path of the unpacked source
  option 2:
    google-chrome --load-extension=.

post (or pre) install:
  disable google's instant search stuff
    from a google search, click the gear icon --> search settings
    select "never show instant results"

keybindings for search:
  'j' and 'k' navigate up and down in the search results
  'enter' to open the selected link
  'o', 'shift-enter' and 'shift-o' to open the selected link with window.open
     the browser will determine whether this is in a new tab or a new window
     chrome 44 appears to open a new window if shift is pressed
     'o' should reliably open a new tab in both chrome 43 and 44
  '/' to select the search box
  'esc' to leave the search box (when it has focus)

usage:
  places a cursor to the left of the selected item (thanks yjsoon)

bugs:
  opening an item and then using the back button doesn't set the cursor
  open links on new tabs without changing focus

license: mit/x
  note: shortcut.5.js and googleKeyboard.js are "unlicensed" and included here for reference only
        the extension loads these directly from google at page-load
